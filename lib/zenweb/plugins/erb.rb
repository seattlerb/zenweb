  # Personally, I find erb's delimiters a bit annoying, so for now,
  # I've added additional gsub's to the content to make it a bit more
  # palatable.
  #
  #     {{ ... }} becomes <%= ... %>
  #     {% ... %} becomes <%  ... %>
  #
  # Unfortunately, those are the delimiters from liquid, so if someone
  # goes and makes a liquid plugin it could clash. But why you'd have
  # liquid and erb on the same file is beyond me... so it prolly won't
  # become a legitimate issue.
